In Programming language principal generally we consider<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/java-object-oriented-programming-system-principles-oops-concepts-for-beginners/#:~:text=State%20tells%20us%20how%20the,representation%20of%20real%20world%20objects." target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""><strong><em>State & Behaviour </em></strong> </a>State can be consider as properties(let, var) & Behaviour as Functions.<br><br>For example: - dog, cat, and vehicle. To illustrate, a dog has <strong>states</strong> like age, color, name, and behaviours like eating, sleeping, and running. <br><strong>State</strong> tells us how the object looks or what properties it has.<br> <strong>Behaviour</strong> tells us what the object does. We can actually represent a real world dog in a program as a software object by defining its states and behaviours. Software objects are the actual representation of real world objects.<br>As per <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/extensions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Apple doc </a><em>Extensions</em> add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumeration, or protocol type.
