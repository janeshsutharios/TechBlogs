### Introduction

`TechBlogs` collects high-quality technical content in one place—perfect for developers who want to explore best practices, deep dives, and learning resources without scouring multiple sites.

---

### Structure

```text
/ (root)
├── docs/
│   ├── article1.md
│   └── article2.md
├── .gitignore
└── LICENSE
```

* **`docs/`**: Contains individual blog posts in Markdown format.
* **`LICENSE`**: CC0-1.0 — meaning all content is dedicated to the public domain for maximum reuse.

---

### Usage

* Browse the `docs/` directory for blog articles on a range of tech topics.
* Want to read offline or tweak formatting? Clone the repo and open the `.md` files locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/janeshsutharios/TechBlogs.git
cd TechBlogs/docs
# open any .md file with your favorite editor or viewer
